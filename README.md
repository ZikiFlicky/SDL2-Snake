# A small implementation of Snake, written in C99 + SDL2
## Why?
I wanted to get familiar with SDL2 so I played around with it a bit and created this.

Why did I want to get familiar with SDL2 in the first place, you're asking?
Well, I was going to write a graphics library for my programming language [Rael](https://github.com/ZikiFlicky/Rael), but thought I might want to see how SDL2 works before wrapping it into my own library. Also, SDL2 is pretty cool, so I was happy to try it out.
## How to build?
Make sure you're on a Posix system and have `libsdl2` installed,
Then run `make`.

This will create an executable for the program, called `snake_sdl`.

To run it, type `./snake_sdl` and enjoy this well-crafted masterpiece.

This was tested only on my Ubuntu 20.04 machine so you might encounter problems on your machine, and if you do, I'll be happy if you open an issue on this GitHub page.
